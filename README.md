    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Neon database connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-connection-string"
    ```
4.  **Sync the database schema:**
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit push
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs

- **State Management:** Used tRPC's React Query integration for server state management (fetching, caching, mutations). Did not implement Zustand as there wasn't a clear need for global client-side state, avoiding potential over-engineering.
- **Content Editor:** Chose Markdown (`react-markdown`) over a rich text editor as suggested in the prompt to save time. Successfully implemented markdown rendering and styling using `@tailwindcss/typography`.
- **Database:** Used Neon for a quick and easy hosted PostgreSQL setup.
- **Styling:** Leveraged shadcn/ui heavily for rapid UI development. Utilized Tailwind v4 alongside `tailwind.config.ts` for plugin management (`@tailwindcss/typography`, `tailwindcss-animate`). Correctly configured `postcss.config.mjs` to ensure plugins load correctly.
- **Optimistic Updates:** Implemented for post deletion on the dashboard for a better UX.
- **Middleware:** Added simple tRPC logging middleware to demonstrate understanding.
- **Deployment Build Issues:** Encountered and resolved several local build issues related to file permissions (EPERM), missing dependencies (`autoprefixer`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`), and configuration conflicts, ensuring the final code builds cleanly on Vercel.

## üìù tRPC Router Structure

The tRPC routers are organized by domain within the `/server/routers` directory:
- `_app.ts`: The main app router that merges all other routers.
- `post.ts`: Handles all CRUD operations, filtering, and searching for blog posts.
- `category.ts`: Handles all CRUD operations for categories.

Procedures use Zod for input validation, and a logging middleware is applied globally via `server/trpc.ts`.

**Time Spent:** Approximately 18 hours.
